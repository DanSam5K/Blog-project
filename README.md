# Blog Post Project

- In this project, got the opportunity to actually build a real Ruby on Rails application. It‚Äôs not a trivially simple one either. An Interesting project that enables us to harness all the power and beauty of Rails on Ruby to build a blog that enables users to perform CRUD actions with the blog post and other users can comment with options to also perform certain actions
